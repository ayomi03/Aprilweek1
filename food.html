            </ul>
            <p>Carbohydrates, or carbs, are sugar molecules. Along with proteins and fats, carbohydrates are one of three main nutrients found in foods and drinks</p>
            <p>Your body breaks down carbohydrates into glucose. Glucose, or blood sugar, is the main source of energy for your body's cells, tissues, and organs</p>

            <h2>protein</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>meat</li>
                <li>fish</li>
                <li>egg</li>
                <li>beans</li>
            </ul>
            <p>protein is polypeptide structures consisting of one or more long chains of amino acid residues</p>
            <p>hey carry out a wide variety of organism functions, including DNA replication, transporting molecules, catalyzing metabolic reactions, and providing structural support to cells</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>fats</h2>
            <p>Fat is a source of essential fatty acids, which the body cannot make itself</p>
            <p>Fat helps the body absorb vitamin A, vitamin D and vitamin E</p>
        </section>
        <ul>
            <li>vegetables</li>
            <li>nuts</li>

        <section>
            <h2>fiber</h2>
            <p>Fiber is a type of carbohydrate that the body can't digest</p>
            <p>Though most carbohydrates are broken down into sugar molecules called glucose, fiber cannot be broken down into sugar molecules, and instead it passes through the body undigested.</p>

            <p>Minerals are substances naturally formed in the Earth</p>
            <p>Minerals are typically solid, inorganic, have a crystal structure and are formed by geological processes naturally</p>

            <h2>vitamins</h2>
            <p>Vitamins and minerals are micronutrients required by the body to carry out a range of normal functions</p>
            <p>However, these micronutrients are not produced in our bodies and must be derived from the food we eat</p>
